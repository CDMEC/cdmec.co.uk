<p>The Chingford and District Model Engineering Club is 71 years old. Our members come from all walks of life and do not necessarily have an engineering background. Membership is open to either sex (several of our female members are qualified train drivers) and starts at 10 for Apprentices, 14 for Juniors and 18 years for full membership.</p>

<p>The club seeks to promote all forms of model engineering and model making, as shown on our club badge (Boats, Planes, Trains & Static Models).</p>

<p>We do not have a boating lake or flying facilities, but with a membership of over 100 you will always find someone with the answer to any problem you may have with your current project.</p>

<p>Virtually every Sunday Morning throughout the year you will find a group of members at the track finding something to do, if it's only having a cup of tea and a chat (there's a lot of that).</p>

<p>The club keeps a large stock of materials available to members at very low cost. We also have a library of books and videos on associated subjects always available, as is our club workshop which is fully equipped to do the larger jobs.</p>
