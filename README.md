Functionality:
MY_Controller: miniGallery() :
    return html for 5 random photos to go at bottom of every page
    get url of 5 random pictures in /img/content/minigallery/*
    maybe use filenames and only use ones with keywords matching those in parameters passed to function?

Gallery speed optimisation: getting album cover photo url's takes ages
