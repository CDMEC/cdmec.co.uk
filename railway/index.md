<div class="perex">
  The Ridgeway Light Railway is at the heart of the club. In the Green Belt Ridgeway Park in Chingford, London, the club builds and maintains Gauge One, 3 &frac12;", 5" and 7 &frac14;" gauge railways.
</div>

There are three tracks at Ridgeway Park:

* Gauge One layout
* Raised Track - 3&frac12;" & 5" gauge
* Ground Level Track - 5" & 7 &frac14;" gauge

The railways are at the heart of the club and were built and are now maintained by club members.

They are the host to many of the clubs social and public events. We run a public service on Sunday afternoons during the summer, Wednesday afternoons during the school summer hoildays and other charity events. Schools also often visit.
