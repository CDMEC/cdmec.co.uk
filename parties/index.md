  Parties are back!
</div>

The club is able to run a limited amount of childrens (or adults) birthday parties throughout the year. The package includes train rides on the raised track and is based around Willow Tree Halt Station. Parties are run from pm to pm. While there is no limit to age we kindly ask to try and keep the number of children to less than 30 as anymore then this and cause queues. 

Cost: £___, a £__ non returnable deposit required to reserve booking.

As the ground track will be in use during parties, the club cannot offer use of it’s catering or toilet facilities. Public toilets are located within the park. We will require an appropriate parent to child ratio for supervision and expect them to join in the fun.

We will run two trains to cater for your needs. We aim for at least one train to be a steam train. Please note steam trains can emit dirt/oil/hot embers which can mark clothes. If you don’t like the idea of steam we can offer electric trains.

All monies raised are are for club funds which go in to the running and improvement of the clubs facilities.

(The parties part of this site is still under contrustion so please bare with...)


<!---It is with great regret that the Committee have had to make the decision to suspend the running of birthday parties during the 2017 season. This is primarily down to our membership numbers falling in recent years and we felt that we would no longer be able to run the parties in a safe manner with the limited members we have. This decision been a difficult one to make as we know the enjoyment that this brings to the public and to the membership however the safety of all those involved has to be our number one priority.--->

<!---We are always looking to recruit new members to grow our club and we hope that if our membership increases we would be able to run birthday parties in the future. If you or you know of anyone who would like to become a member please [contact our Secretary](/contact) or speak to one of our members at the railway.--->
