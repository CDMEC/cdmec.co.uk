            <p>Founded on 30<sup>th</sup> November 1945 through an advert in &quot;The Model Engineer&quot;, the Chingford &amp; District Model Engineering Club has flourished into a society of knowledgeable engineers &amp; enthusiasts with a thriving youth section.</p>

        <p><a href="/img/content/about-01.jpg" data-lightbox="img1"><img src="/img/content/about-01.jpg" alt="Mugs" width="250" class="f-right" /></a>The Chingford and District Model Engineering Club is <?php echo date("Y")-1945; ?> years old. Our members come from all walks of life and do not necessarily have an engineering background. Membership is open to either sex (several of our female members are qualified train drivers) and starts at 10 for Apprentices, 14 for Juniors and 18 years for full membership.</p>
        <p>The club seeks to promote all forms of model engineering and model making, as shown on our club badge (Boats, Planes, Trains &amp; Static Models).</p>

        <p>Virtually every Sunday Morning throughout the year you will find a group of members at the track finding something to do, if it's only having a cup of tea and a chat (there's a lot of that).</p>
        <p>The club keeps a large stock of materials available to members at very low cost. We also have a library of books and videos on associated subjects always available, as is our club workshop which is fully equipped to do the larger jobs.</p>
